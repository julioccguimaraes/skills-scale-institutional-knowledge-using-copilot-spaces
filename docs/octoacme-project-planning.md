# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Developers, UX Designer, QA Lead, Business Analyst, DevOps Engineer, Release Manager as applicable)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (PM, PdM, Business Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD), including testability requirements with QA Lead
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (DevOps Engineer, Release Manager)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (Release Manager, PM)
