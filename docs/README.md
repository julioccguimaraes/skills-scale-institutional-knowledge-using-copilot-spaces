## Project Management at OctoAcme

OctoAcme delivers software through a lightweight, iterative approach built on a few core principles:

- **Iterative delivery** – work is broken into small, testable increments so value reaches customers early and feedback loops stay short.
- **Explicit roles** – every project has a named Project Manager, Product Manager, and defined team roles so ownership is always clear.
- **GitHub-based tracking** – issues, pull requests, and project boards are the single source of truth for work status and decisions.
- **Risk management** – risks are identified early, logged in a register, and communicated proactively to stakeholders.
- **Regular retrospectives** – after every release the team reflects on what worked and what to improve, creating a culture of continuous learning.
